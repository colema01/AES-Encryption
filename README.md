Overview
I developed a file encryption and decryption program using Rust that securely encrypts files using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. The program allows users to encrypt the contents of a file and then decrypt it back to its original form. It demonstrates the fundamentals of cryptography and file input/output operations, as well as Rust's core features like memory safety, ownership, and references.

The goal of this project was to improve my understanding of Rust's systems programming capabilities and explore cryptographic principles in a real-world context. By working on this project, I was able to deepen my knowledge of file handling, encryption algorithms, and how Rust’s strict ownership model enhances security in memory management.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code as my primary tool for writing and running the Rust code. The project was managed and compiled using Cargo, Rust’s build system and package manager. Additionally, I employed GitHub to track code changes and manage the project.

The programming language is Rust, which provides strong memory safety and concurrency features. I utilized libraries like aes for encryption and rand for generating random numbers to create secure encryption keys.

Future Work
{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

Add a user interface to make it easier to interact with the program.
Implement additional encryption algorithms such as RSA for asymmetric encryption.
Improve error handling and user input validation.
Add functionality to encrypt larger files using streams instead of loading the entire file into memory.
